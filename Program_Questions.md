## Structures and Files

1. C program to create a sequential file for storing employee records with each record having following information:
    | Employee_Id | Name | Department | Salary | Age |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Non-Zero
    Positive Integer | 25
    Characters | 25
    Characters | Positive integer | Positive integer |
    Write necessary functions to perform the following operations:
    a. Read the details of a record.
    b. Display all the records in the file.
    c. Search for a specific records based on Department. In case if the required record is not found, suitable message should be displayed.

## Linked Lists

1. Define a structure to represent a node in a Singly Linked List. Each node must contain following information: player name, team name and batting average. Develop a C program using functions to perform the following operations on a list of cricket players:
    a) Add a player at the end of the list.
    b) Search for a specific player and update his/her batting average    if the player exists.
    c) Display the details of all the players.

1. Develop a C program to add two two-variable polynomials using Singly Linked list.
[**Program**](https://github.com/CodebyKumar/Data-Structures-in-C/blob/main/LinkedLists/SLL_poly.c)

1. Develop a C program to construct two ordered singly linked lists using functions to perform following operations:
    a. Insert an element into a list.
    b. Merge the two lists.
    c. Display the contents of the list.
    Display the two input lists and the resultant list with suitable messages.
[**Program**](https://github.com/CodebyKumar/Data-Structures-in-C/blob/main/LinkedLists/SLL_lists.c)

1. Define a structure to represent a node in a Linear Doubly Linked List with header node. Each node must contain following information: Student name, USN, branch and year of admission. Header node should maintain the count of number of students in the list. Develop a C program using functions to perform the following operations on a list of students:
    a. Add a student at the beginning of the list.
    b. Display the details of the students of a specified branch.
    Display the details of all the students.

## Trees

1. C program to perform the following operations:
    a. Construct a binary search tree of integers.
    b. Traverse the tree in Inorder.
    c. Delete a given node from the BST.
[**Program**](https://github.com/CodebyKumar/Data-Structures-in-C/blob/main/Tree/BST_oper.c)

1. C program to construct an expression tree for a given postfix expression and evaluate the expression tree.
