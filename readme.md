## Structures and Files

* C program to create a sequential file for storing employee records with each record having following information:
    | Employee_Id | Name | Department | Salary | Age |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Non-ZeroPositive Integer | 25 Characters | 25 Characters | Positive integer | Positive integer |

   Write necessary functions to perform the following operations:
   - Read the details of a record.
   - Display all the records in the file.
   - Search for a specific records based on Department. In case if the required record is not found, suitable message should be displayed.
